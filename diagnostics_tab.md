The **Diagnostics** menu in pfSense is a toolbox packed with features to help monitor, troubleshoot, and manage your system.

1. **Command Prompt**: Execute shell commands directly from the pfSense web interface for quick diagnostics or administrative tasks.

2. **Factory Defaults**: Reset the system configuration to factory defaults if needed. Be careful, as this will erase all custom configurations.

3. **Backup & Restore**: Manage system configuration backups and restore them in case of issues or migrations.

4. **Packet Capture**: Capture network packets passing through specified interfaces for in-depth traffic analysis.

5. **DNS Lookup**: Perform DNS lookups to check domain name resolution and troubleshoot DNS issues.

6. **Ping**: Test connectivity to external or internal hosts using ICMP echo requests (ping).

7. **Traceroute**: Diagnose network routing issues by tracing the path packets take to reach a destination.

8. **Nmap**: (If installed) Run network scans to identify devices and services on your network.

9. **ARP Table**: View the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table, showing IP-to-MAC mappings on the LAN.

10. **Routing Table**: Check the system's routing table to ensure routes are configured correctly.

11. **States**: View active firewall states for detailed information about current network connections.

12. **Logs**: Access system logs for troubleshooting issues related to the firewall, DHCP, VPNs, and more.

13. **Test Port**: Check the status of specific ports on remote hosts for connectivity and firewall troubleshooting.

14. **Activity Monitor**: Monitor CPU and memory usage, along with network traffic statistics.

15. **PF Info**: Examine pf (packet filter) information to understand the firewall's current rules and states.

16. **System Activity**: Access the system's activity monitor (similar to the `top` command), showing active processes and resource utilization.

17. **Snapshots**: Manage system snapshots to capture and revert to specific configurations.

18. **Hardware**: Check hardware-related information like CPU temperature, network card statistics, and more.

19. **Wi-Fi Status**: If Wi-Fi is enabled, view wireless network status and connected devices.

Each of these tools is crucial for maintaining, troubleshooting, or optimizing your pfSense system. Let me know if you'd like help with a specific diagnostic feature!
